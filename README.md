## Important

This repository is also a good point to have an idea of course creation for the DataCamp platform. You can freely use and adapt this content to create your own interactive courses for our platform. However, note that the submission correctness testing system that this course depends on is suboptimal to the package that DataCamp currently uses for its interactive courses. Please check out the [SCT design guide](https://teach.datacamp.com/sct-design) for more information on this matter.
